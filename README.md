Viveur
======

Package for [VIVO](http://vivoweb.org) Integration at the [Erasmus University Rotterdam](http://www.eur.nl).

This software has been designed to export data from our databases to RDFXML using the BIBO/VIVO Core ontologies. It is provided here, since it might be of interest to other institutions trying to solve the same problem.

At the moment only data from our Metis Research Information System is exported. The Metis system is in use in many universities in the Netherlands.

Some [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) are provided, as well as a document with a [usage / howto](USAGE.md).
